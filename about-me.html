        Hi! I'm a Manchester based aspiring junior software developer currently
        doing a bootcamp at Northcoders, a 14 week software development course
        with the curriculum of the fundamental and essential modern day
        engineering skills. After spending 5 years, working in retail I decided
        after talking to a friend who made the same career transition
        recommended them to me. After seeing his success after the bootcamp I
        decided to sign up!

        <br />
        <br />
        I'm a down to earth person who loves reading and has a passion for
        learning new things. I work well solo or with-in a team! Through-out my
        walks of life, i've picked up various skills from basic communication to
        newly developed coding skill.
